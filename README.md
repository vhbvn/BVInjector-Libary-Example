# BVInjector-Libary-Example

A minimal C++ console application demonstrating how to integrate and use the BVInjector library for DLL injection.
This example shows how to set up the injector menu, select DLLs, choose a target process, and perform manual mapping injectionâ€”all with just a few lines of code.
